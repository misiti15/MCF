"""RW1-gapdn-bounce-flowsell-short-FD - FULL-DAY version of RW1-gapdn-bounce-flowsell-short (owner decision 2026-10-09: full-day versions
first, then identify time frames that may be better; Testing account).
Source module: research/bdi/rework1008/modules/RW1-gapdn-bounce-flowsell-short.py (copied; logic identical except the removed clause).
Removed: `(tod >= 950) & (tod <= 1100)` - the clause that limited WHEN the rule may fire (source module window 950-1100
ET bar close; source YAML window [950, 1100]).
Kept: every other condition, side, exit geometry and LAYERS (time layer replaced by the full-day note).
Run with min_adv 95000000 and window [950, 1500] (bar close ET).
Check: research/bdi/fullday/verify.json (this mask AND the source window == the source mask, open history).
Source docstring (provenance only - its results describe the WINDOWED rule, not this one):
    RW1-gapdn-bounce-flowsell-short - BDI rule-18 rework 2026-10-08 (research/bdi/rework1008). gap-down name bouncing to RSI 55-65 while heavy net selling persists.
    Lineage: MF2 (MF-open-rsimidhi-flowsell). Side short, exit t1s1 (R = 0.25 x daily ATR, exit by 15:55). Indicators on 5-minute bars.
    Source ran with min_adv 95000000 and window [950, 1100] (bar close ET).
    Lab (train 06-30..08-25 / valid 08-26..09-15, production haircut): train +0.186R t 2.47 n 323;
    valid +0.171R t 2.45 n 132. NOT scored on the locked holdouts. Research finalist only, not live.
